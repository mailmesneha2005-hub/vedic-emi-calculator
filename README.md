# Vedic Financial Compute Engine

A Vedic-mathematics inspired EMI and interest calculator optimized for fast financial computation.

---

## Problem Statement
Traditional EMI and interest calculations rely on multiplication-heavy and power-based operations,
which can be computationally expensive on low-power or embedded financial systems.

This project is developed for **Problem Statement 18 – Vedic Financial Compute Engine**
at the **InnVedX Code Hackathon**.

---

## Solution Overview
This project implements a Vedic-inspired financial compute engine using principles of
**Nikhilam Sutra** from Vedic Mathematics.

The system optimizes EMI calculations by reducing power-based computations and replacing them
with lightweight arithmetic approximations, resulting in improved execution speed.

---

## Methodology
1. Take user input: loan amount, interest rate, and loan duration.
2. Calculate EMI using the standard mathematical formula.
3. Calculate EMI using a Vedic (Nikhilam-inspired) approximation.
4. Measure execution time using `System.nanoTime()`.
5. Compare execution times to evaluate performance improvement.
